__result.txt__

The result.txt file contains the following columns:

The below are the mean or std feature columns extracted from the original [features.txt](https://github.com/shrikeac/gettingCleaningDataProj/blob/master/UCIHARDataset/features.txt).  

The values under these columns are the average for each activity and each subject.

The units of the values are the same as in the original train and test files.

The last 2 columns contain the subject and the activity.  Notice that activityId has been removed on purpose and the activity column refers to the activity name.  The result.txt file is sorted by activityId in ascending order before it was removed.

* "subject* "
* "activity* "
